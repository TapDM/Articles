     knockdown fly lines report reduced BSF protein levels lead severe respiratory deficiency delayed

     lengths specific mitochondrial mRNAs, accompanied enrichment unprocessed polycistronic RNA intermediates.
     Furthermore, observed significant reduction mRNA steady state levels, despite increased novo transcription.
     Surprisingly, mitochondrial novo translation increased abnormal mitochondrial translation products present      knockdown flies, suggesting BSF role coordinating mitochondrial translation addition role      mRNA maturation stability. report novel function BSF flies demonstrate important
