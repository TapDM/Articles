Plants evolved range cellular responses maintain developmental homeostasis survive range temperatures.  vivo vitro functions BOBBER1 (BOB1), NudC domain containing
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) small heat shock protein. BOB1 essential gene required normal partitioning patterning apical domain Arabidopsis embryo. BOB1 loss function mutants embryo lethal, used partial loss function allele (bob1-3) demonstrate BOB1 required organismal thermotolerance postem-
bryonic development. Recombinant BOB1 protein functions molecular chaperone prevents aggregation model
