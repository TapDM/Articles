     Abstract
     Malpighian tubules (MT) Drosophila melanogaster osmoregulatory organs maintain ionic balance remove
     toxic substances body. Additionally act autonomous immune sensing organs, secrete antimicrobial
     peptides response invading microbial pathogens. antimicrobial peptides (AMP) diptericin, cecropinA,
     drosocin attacinA constitutively expressed regulated developmental stage specific manner.      developmental expression begins 3rd instar larval stage immune challenge increases expression      folds. Spatial variatons level expression MT tissue observed. mortality 3rd instar larvae fed      bacterial food earlier larval stages, coinciding onset innate immunity response      MT. Ectopic expression AMP imparts better resistance infection  loss function AMP      directed RNAi reduces host survival immune challenge. AMP secreted MT exhibit bactericidal activity.
     Expression NF-kB transcription factor, Relish, coincides activation immune responsive genes MT,
     demonstrating immune regulation MT developmental control governed Imd pathway.
