Low-oxygen stress imposed field waterlogging impediment plant germination growth. Plants respond waterlogging complex set physiological responses regulated transcriptional, cellular, tissue levels. Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) NAC domain-containing gene ANAC102 shown induced 0.1  oxygen 30
min roots shoots 0.1  oxygen-treated germinating seeds. Overexpression ANAC102 altered expression number genes, including previously identified low-oxygen responsive. Decreasing ANAC102
expression effect global gene transcription plants did alter expression patterns low-oxygen-stressed seeds.
Increasing decreasing expression ANAC102 did affect adult plant survival low-oxygen stress. Decreased ANAC102
expression significantly decreased germination efficiency following 0.1  oxygen treatment, increased expression effect germination. protective role germination appeared specific low-oxygen stress, implicating ANAC102 important regulator seed germination flooding.
