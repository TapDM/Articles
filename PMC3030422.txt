Abstract
Delineating ancestral gene relations large set sequenced eukaryotic genomes allowed rigorously examine
links evolutionary functional traits. classified 86  1.36 million protein-coding genes 40
vertebrates, 23 arthropods, 32 fungi orthologous groups linked 90  Gene Ontology InterPro annotations. Quantifying properties ortholog phyletic retention, copy-number variation, sequence
conservation, examined correlations gene essentiality functional traits. half vertebrate,
arthropod, fungal orthologs universally present lineage. universal orthologs preferentially
distributed groups single-copy multicopy genes, sequence evolution predominantly single-
copy orthologous groups markedly constrained. Essential genes representative model organisms, Mus
musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, significantly enriched universal orthologs lineage, essential-gene-containing groups consistently exhibit greater sequence conservation  study eukaryotic gene repertoire evolution identifies shared fundamental principles highlights lineage-specific
features, confirms essential genes highly retained conclusively supports ‘‘knockout-rate prediction’’ stronger constraints essential gene sequence evolution.  distinction sequence conservation single- versus multicopy orthologs quantitatively prominent orthologous groups essential genes. previously underappreciated difference tolerance gene duplications contrasting
evolutionary modes ‘‘single-copy control’’ versus ‘‘multicopy license’’ reflect major evolutionary mechanism allows extended exploration gene sequence space.
Key words: orthologs, essential genes, molecular evolution, vertebrates, arthropods, fungi.
