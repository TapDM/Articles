An essential protein-binding domain nuclear RNase P RNA

ABSTRACT
Eukaryotic RNase P RNase MRP endoribonucleases composed RNA protein subunits. RNA
subunits enzyme share substantial secondary structural features, protein subunits shared  conserved RNA subdomains, designated P3, previously shown required nucleolar localization. Phylogenetic sequence analysis suggests P3 domain interacts proteins common RNase P RNase MRP, conclusion strengthened earlier observation essential
