     Abstract
     Background: bloodstream forms Trypanosoma brucei, causative agent sleeping sickness, rely solely      glycolysis ATP production. generally accepted pyruvate major end-product excreted glucose
     metabolism proliferative long-slender bloodstream forms parasite, virtually production succinate
     acetate, main end-products excreted glycolysis trypanosomatid adaptative forms, including
     procyclic insect form T. brucei.

     Methodology/Principal Findings: comparative NMR analysis showed bloodstream long-slender procyclic
     trypanosomes excreted equivalent amounts acetate succinate glucose metabolism. Key enzymes acetate
     production glucose-derived pyruvate threonine expressed mitochondrion long-slender forms,
     produces 1.4-times acetate glucose threonine presence equal      carbon sources. using combination reverse genetics NMR analyses, showed mitochondrial production      acetate essential long-slender forms, blocking acetate biosynthesis carbon sources induces cell
     death. confirmed absence threonine lethal phenotype RNAi-mediated depletion pyruvate
     dehydrogenase, involved glucose-derived acetate production. addition, showed novo fatty acid
     biosynthesis acetate essential parasite, demonstrated lethal phenotype metabolic analyses      RNAi-mediated depletion acetyl-CoA synthetase, catalyzing cytosolic step pathway.

     Conclusions/Significance: Acetate produced mitochondrion glucose threonine synthetically essential      long-slender mammalian forms T. brucei feed essential fatty acid biosynthesis ‘‘acetate shuttle’’
     recently described procyclic insect form parasite. Consequently, key enzymatic steps pathway,
     particularly acetyl-CoA synthetase, constitute new attractive drug targets trypanosomiasis.
