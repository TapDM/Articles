Background. Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene (EWSR1), known EWS, fused number different
partner genes result chromosomal translocation diverse sarcomas. Despite involvement EWSR1 diverse sarcomas, vivo function wild type EWSR1 remains unclear. Principal Findings. identified zebrafish
EWSR1 orthologues, ewsr1a ewsr1b, demonstrate genes expressed maternally, expressed
ubiquitously zebrafish embryonic development. Morpholino induced knockdown zebrafish ewsr1 genes
led mitotic defects multipolar abnormal mitotic spindles starting bud stage (10 hour post-
fertilization (hpf)). abnormalities mitotic spindles followed p53-mediated apoptosis developing central
nervous (CNS) leading reduction number proneural cells, disorganization neuronal networks, embryonic lethality 5 days post-fertilization. siRNA silencing EWSR1 Hela cells resulted mitotic defects accompanied apoptotic cell death, indicating role EWSR1 conserved zebrafish human. Conclusions. Ewsr1
maintains mitotic integrity proneural cell survival early zebrafish development.
