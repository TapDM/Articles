Caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death extensively studied cultured cells embryonic development, existence analogous molecular pathways single-cell species uncertain. reduced enthusiasm applying advanced genetic tools available yeast study cell death regulation.  partial characterization mammals additional genetically encoded cell death mechanisms, lead range dying cell morphologies necrosis, suggests
potential applications yeast genetics. light, revisited topic gene-dependent cell death yeast determine prevalence yeast genes capacity contribute cell-autonomous death. developed rigorous strategy allowing sufficient time gene-dependent events occur, insufficient time evolve new populations, applied strategy Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene knockout collection. Unlike sudden heat shock, ramped heat stimulus
delivered minutes thermocycler, coupled assessment viability automated counting microscopic
colonies revealed highly reproducible gene-specific survival phenotypes, typically persist alternative conditions.
Unexpectedly, identified 800 yeast knockout strains exhibit significantly increased survival following insult,
implying genes contribute cell death. death mechanisms uncharacterized, study
facilitates exploration.
