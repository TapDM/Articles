 wall-associated kinase (WAK) gene family unique subfamily receptor-like kinases (RLKs) plants. WAK-RLKs play
roles cell expansion, pathogen resistance, metal tolerance Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Rice (Oryza sativa) far WAK-RLK genes Arabidopsis, functions rice WAK-RLKs poorly understood. study, rice WAK-RLK gene, DEFECT EARLY EMBRYO SAC1 (OsDEES1), involved regulation early embryo sac
development. OsDEES1 silencing RNA interference caused high rate female sterility. Crossing experiments showed female reproductive organs lacking OsDEES1 carried functional defect. detailed investigation ovaries OsDEES1 RNA interference plants indicated knockdown OsDEES1 expression did affect megasporogenesis disturbed female gametophyte formation, resulting degenerated embryo sac defective seed formation.
OsDEES1 exhibited tissue-speciï¬?c expression pattern ï¬‚owers seedlings. ovary, OsDEES1 expressed megagametophyte region surrounding nucellus cells ovule near micropylar region. OsDEES1 membrane-localized protein unique sequence compared WAK-RLKs. data indicate OsDEES1 plays role rice sexual reproduction regulating female gametophyte development. study offers new insight functions WAK-RLK family.
