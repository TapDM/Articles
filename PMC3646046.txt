     Abstract
     Taste essential sense survival organisms. insects, taste particularly important allows detect
     avoid ingesting plant toxins, L-canavanine. previously showed L-canavanine toxic      Drosophila melanogaster flies able detect toxin food. L-canavanine ligand DmXR, variant
     G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) belonging metabotropic glutamate receptor subfamily expressed bitter-
     sensitive taste neurons Drosophila. transduce signal intracellularly, GPCR activate heterotrimeric G proteins
     constituted  b c subunits. aim study identify Ga protein required L-canavanine
     detection Drosophila. using pharmacological approach, demonstrated DmXR best coupling      Gao protein subtype.  using genetic, behavioral assays electrophysiology, Gao47A required      bitter-sensitive taste neurons L-canavanine sensitivity. conclusion, study revealed Gao47A plays crucial role
     L-canavanine detection.
