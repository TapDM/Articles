Alternative Oxidase Mediates Pathogen Resistance Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Infection

     Abstract
     Background: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis human thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungus. Survival P. brasiliensis inside
     host depends adaptation fungal pathogen different conditions, oxidative stress imposed      immune cells.

     Aims Methodology: study, evaluated role alternative oxidase (AOX), enzyme involved      intracellular redox balancing, host-P. brasiliensis interaction. generated mitotically stable P. brasiliensis AOX
