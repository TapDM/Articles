     Abstract
     Int6 proto-oncogene implicated various types cancer, mechanisms underlying activity clear. Int6
     encodes subunit eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, interacts related complexes,      proteasome, activity regulated Int6 S. pombe, COP9 signalosome. COP9 signalosome regulates
     activity Cullin-Ring Ubiquitin Ligases deneddylation cullin subunit. report generation      analysis Drosophila mutants Int6. mutants lethal demonstrating Int6 essential gene. mutant
     larvae accumulate high levels non-neddylated Cul1, suggesting Int6 positive regulator cullin neddylation.
     Overexpression Int6 cell culture leads accumulation neddylated cullins, supporting positive role Int6
     regulating neddylation. Int6 COP9 signalosome play opposing roles regulation cullin neddylation.
