Elute PCR product 30 μl            sterile distilled water dilute ~50 ng/μl concentration. purified product used immediately transformation (step 1.5)            stored -20 °C 6 months use.

  4. Preparing Hfr Cavalli competent cells donor construction
       1. Inoculate ml saturated overnight culture Hfr Cavalli strain 70 ml fresh Luria-Bertani (LB) medium 35 μl 50
          μg/ml ampicillin 250 ml flask. Incubate culture 32 °C shaking 220 rpm optical density (OD) 600 nm ~0.5-0.6
          obtained (~2 hr).
       2. Transfer culture water bath heat induction λred recombination system16 42 °C 15 min shaking 160 rpm.
          Stop induction transferring culture chilled ice-slurry water bath 10-20 min 160 rpm. Make sure cells
          cold point transformation; use tubes cuvettes chilled ice 15 min prior use.
       3. Divide culture equally 2 pre-chilled 50 ml polypropylene tubes (~35 ml culture tube) centrifuge 4,400 x g 6 min           4 °C.
       4. Discard supernatant, suspend cell pellet gentle inversion ~50 ml ice-cold sterile distilled water. Centrifuge           cells 4,400 x g 6 min 4 °C. Discard supernatant suspend cell pellet 20 ml ice-cold sterile 10

  5. Transformation
       1. Add 100 ng purified PCR product step 1.3.1 competent cells. Flick tube allow suspension sit ice 5 min.
       2. Transfer suspension ice-cold competent cells DNA pre-chilled electroporation cuvette. Electroporate cell mixture            2.5 kV, 25 μF, 200 ohms setting 2 mm gap cuvette  e. using different cuvette, manufacturer's instructions

       3. incubation, centrifuge cells 4,400 x g 5 min room temperature. Remove approximately 850 μl supernatant,            suspend cell pellet remaining liquid.
       4. Spread cells pre-warmed LB plates containing 17 μg/ml Cm, incubate 32 °C overnight. Pick individual transformant
           colonies streak LB-Cm plates mutant confirmation. recommend avoiding largest transformant colonies order            reduce possibility picking strains rare suppressor mutations. streak transformants LB-Kan confirm            strains Kan resistant.

            Note: Cm resistance marker used make donor strains, don't expect donor mutants Kan resistant.             streaking transformants LB-Kan LB-Cm plates, ensure donor mutation itself did cause Kan
            resistance. step performed target mutations affect ability strain survive Kan, double
            mutants effectively using eSGA donor strains survive selection steps. merely precautionary
            logical step catch unexpected phenotypes issues interfere completion eSGA screens.             step skipped, controls identify failed screens.  earlier detection donor resistant Kan
            eliminate series unproductive unnecessary steps. possible reasons strain grow Kan include
            example expired antibiotic use wrong PCR product strain transformation. issues             identified dealt early procedure aid control, required, recommended eSGA.
