     Abstract
     Modifications histone tails involved regulation wide range biological processes including cell cycle, cell
     survival, cell division, cell differentiation. modifications, histone methylation plays critical role cardiac
     skeletal muscle differentiation. earlier studies, SMYD3 methyltransferase activity histone H3
     lysine 4, regulation involved tumorigenesis human colon, liver, breast. clarify role      Smyd3 development, studied expression patterns zebrafish embryos effect suppression      development using Smyd3-specific antisense morpholino-oligonucleotides. transcripts smyd3      expressed zebrafish embryos developmental stages examined knockdown smyd3 embryos resulted      pericardial edema defects trunk structure. addition, phenotypes associated abnormal
     expression heart-chamber markers including cmlc2, amhc vmhc, abnormal expression myogenic
     regulatory factors including myod myog. data suggest Smyd3 plays important role development      heart skeletal muscle.
