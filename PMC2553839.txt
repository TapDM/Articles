 transcription factor DAF-16/forkhead box O (FOXO) critical longevity determinant diverse organisms, molecular basis transcriptional activity regulated remains largely unknown. report Caenorhabditis elegans homolog host cell factor 1 (HCF-1) represents new longevity modulator functions negative regulator DAF-16. C. elegans, hcf-1 inactivation caused daf-16-dependent lifespan extension 40  heightened resistance specific stress stimuli. HCF-1 showed ubiquitous nuclear localization physically associated DAF-16. Furthermore, loss hcf-1 resulted elevated DAF-16 recruitment promoters target genes altered expression subset DAF-16-regulated genes. propose HCF-1 modulates C.
