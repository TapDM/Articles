ABSTRACT
RNA-binding proteins target mRNA coding regions emerging regulators post-transcriptional processes eukaryotes. newly identified RNA-binding protein, RBP42, targets coding region mRNAs insect form African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei. RBP42 essential protein associates polysome-bound
mRNAs cytoplasm. global survey RBP42-bound mRNAs performed applying HITS-CLIP technology, captures protein–RNA interactions vivo using UV light. Specific RBP42–mRNA interactions, mRNA interactions known RNA-binding protein, purified using specific antibodies. Target RNA sequences identified quantified using high-throughput RNA sequencing. Analysis revealed RBP42 bound mainly coding region mRNAs encode proteins involved cellular energy metabolism. mechanism RBP42’s function unclear present, speculate RBP42 plays critical role modulating T. brucei energy metabolism.
Keywords: trypanosomes; mRNA translation; NTF-2 containing proteins; HITS-CLIP analysis
