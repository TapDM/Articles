  Abstract
  Background: Ydj1 Sis1 structurally functionally distinct Hsp40 proteins yeast cytosol. Sis1   essential gene ydj1 gene essential growth elevated temperatures complement sis1
  gene deletion. Truncated polypeptides capable complementing sis1 gene deletion comprise J-domain   Sis1 Ydj1 connected G/F region Sis1  Ydj1). Sis1 mutants G/F deleted
  G/M maintained capable complementing sis1 gene deletion.
  Results: investigate relevance central domains structure function Ydj1 Sis1   prepared Sis1 constructs deleting specific domains. mutants decreased affinity heated luciferase   equally capable stimulating ATPase activity Hsp70. Detailed low resolution structures obtained   overall flexibility Hsp40 mutants assessed using SAXS methods. Deletion G/M   G/M plus CTDI domains little impact quaternary structure Sis1 analyzed SAXS technique.
   deletion ZFLR-CTDI changed relative position J-domains Ydj1 way   ended resembling Sis1. results revealed G/F G/M regions flexible

  Conclusions: results suggest central domains, previously appointed important features   substrate binding, relevant keeping J-domains specific relative positions. clamp-like
