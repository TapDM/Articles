ABSTRACT
Mutants Drosophila crooked neck (crn ) gene embryonic lethal phenotype severe developmental
defects. unusual crn protein consists sixteen tandem repeats 34 amino acid tetratricopeptide (TPR)
protein recognition domain. Crn-like TPR elements RNA processing proteins, unknown TPR repeats crn protein contribute Drosophila development. isolated Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae gene, CLF1, encodes crooked neck-like factor. CLF1 essential gene lethal

Yeast hybrid analyses vitro binding studies Clf1p interacts specifically differentially U1 snRNP-Prp40p protein yeast U2AF65 homolog, Mud2p. Intriguingly, Prp40p Mud2p bind phylogenetically conserved branchpoint binding protein (BBP/SF1). results indicate Clf1p acts scaf-
