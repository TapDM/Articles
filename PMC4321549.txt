Abstract
Dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) catalyses key step branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) biosynthetic pathway exists numerous organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, humans. Arabidopsis thaliana, DHAD encoded single gene (AT3G23940), biological function controlling plant development remains uncharacter-
ized. study, showed DHAD highly expressed vegetative reproductive tissues. essential

Interestingly, knockdown mutants hypersensitive salt stress, heavy metal stress, implying BCAAs act osmolytes salt tolerance. second amino acid shown confer function addition documented proline. results provide evidence BCAA biosynthesis plays important roles gametophyte root development, BCAA homeostasis contributes adaptation Arabidopsis salinity stress.

Key words:  Arabidopsis, branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD), gametogenesis, root
development, salt stress.
