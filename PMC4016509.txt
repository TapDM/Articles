  Abstract
  Background: ATAD2 associated cellular processes, cell growth, migration invasion. 
  studies conducted molecular biological function ATAD2 gene hepatocellular
  carcinoma (HCC).
  Methods: protein mRNA level expression ATAD2 examined tissues cell lines. Prognostic
  significance analyzed Kaplan-Meier survival method Cox regression. ATAD2 knockdown used
  analyze cell proliferation invasion. upstream downstream ATAD2 analyzed RT 2 Profilerâ„¢
  PCR array luciferasex fluorescence 
  Results: ATAD2 highly expressed liver cancer samples correlated poor survival. High ATAD2
  expression positively correlated metastasis (P = 0.005) independent prognostic factor   HCC (P = 0.001). ATAD2 depletion RNA interference reduced capacity invasion proliferation   led G1 phase arrest vitro. study revealed miR-372 upstream target ATAD2 miR-372   bound directly 3â€² untranslated region (3â€² UTR). addition, ATAD2 knockdown extremely regulate
  APC expression regulate CTNNA1 mRNA level.
  Conclusions: findings demonstrated miR-372 suppressed expression ATAD2, highly
  expressed HCC exerted proto-oncogene effect hepatic carcinogenesis. conclusion, ATAD2   promote HCC progression.
