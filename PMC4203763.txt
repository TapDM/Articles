    Spns2 expression induced apoptosis knockdown enhanced cell migration non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.
    Metabolically, Spns2 expression increased extracellular S1P level knockdown intracellular. Pharmacological
    inhibition S1P synthesis abolished augmented cell migration mediated Spns2 knockdown, indicating     intracellular S1P plays key role process. Cell signaling studies indicated Spns2 expression impaired GSK-3b     Stat3 mediated pro-survival pathways. Conversely, pathways activated Spns2 knockdown, explains     increased cell migration crucial migration. Alterations Spns2 affect enzymes
    involved S1P metabolism, including sphingosine kinases, S1P phosphatases, S1P lyase 1. Genetically, Spns2 mRNA
