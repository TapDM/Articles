  Abstract
  Background: Young genes genes positive selection commonly contribute adaptive phenotypic
  evolution. Early developmental stages important establishing phenotypes, helpful   studying evolutionary patterns rapidly evolving genes.
  Results:  performed weighted gene expression network analysis identify modules expressed
  genes different stages Drosophila melanogaster development. young genes, including duplicated,
  orphan, young lncRNA genes, significantly enriched modules associated specific developmental
  stages. addition, genes undergoing rapid amino acid sequence evolution driven positive selection showed   similar proportion essentiality genes, enrichment modules specific developmental stages.
  Conclusions: integrative analysis revealed important roles origin new genes rapid amino acid
  sequence evolution development account specific phenotype evolution Drosophila melanogaster.
