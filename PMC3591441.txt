     Abstract
     Background: African trypanosomes capable pyrimidine biosynthesis salvage preformed pyrimidines      host, unknown process essential parasite.

     Methodology/Principal Findings: Pyrimidine requirements growth investigated using strictly pyrimidine-free
     media, single added pyrimidine sources. Growth rates wild-type bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei

     Conclusions/Significance: Pyrimidine salvage essential function bloodstream T. b. brucei. 
     trypanosomes lacking novo pyrimidine biosynthesis completely dependent extracellular pyrimidine source,
