 Abstract
 Background: Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme, plays vital role
 novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway malaria parasites. genes identified Plasmodium
 spp. encoding cytosolic SHMT (cSHMT) putative mitochondria SHMT (mSHMT), roles  fully investigated.
 Methods: presence Plasmodium SHMT isoforms intra-erythrocytic stage assessed based  gene expression using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Localization studies Plasmodium SHMT isoforms  performed transfection fluorescent-tagged gene constructs P. falciparum expressions fluorescent
 fusion proteins parasites observed using laser scanning confocal microscope. Genetic targeting  homologous recombination used study essentiality SHMT Plasmodium spp.
 Results: Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed expression genes intra-erythrocytic
 development. Localization studies using P. falciparum expressing fluorescent-tagged SHMT showed PfcSHMT-
 red fluorescent fusion protein (PfcSHMT-DsRed) localized cytoplasm, PfmSHMT-green fluorescent
 fusion protein (PfmSHMT-GFP) localized Mitotracker™-labelled mitochondria predicted. essentiality  plasmodial cSHMT inferred transfection experiments recovery viable knock parasites  achieved, unless complemented functional equivalent copy shmt.
 Conclusions: Distinct compartment localizations PfSHMT observed cytoplasmic  mitochondrial isoforms, evidence provided indispensable role plasmodial cSHMT indicating  valid target development novel anti-malarials.
