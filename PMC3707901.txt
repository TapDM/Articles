     Abstract
     Mutations gene drop-dead (drd) cause diverse phenotypes adult Drosophila melanogaster including early lethality,
     neurodegeneration, tracheal defects, gut dysfunction, reduced body mass, female sterility. Despite identification      drd gene itself, causes early lethality neurodegeneration mutant flies remain unknown. determine
     pattern drd expression associated neurodegenerative phenotype, knockdown drd various Gal4
     drivers performed. Early adult lethality neurodegeneration observed knockdown drd tracheal
     independent insertions breathless-Gal4 driver knockdown tracheal      DJ717-Gal4 driver. Surprisingly, rescue drd expression exclusively tracheae mutant
     flies rescued neurodegenerative phenotype adult lethality. Gut dysfunction, measured defecation rate,
     rescued flies, gut function appeared normal tracheal-specific knockdown drd. Finally,      hypothesis tracheal dysfunction drd mutants results hypoxia tested. Hypoxia-sensitive reporter transgenes
     (LDH-Gal4 LDH-LacZ) placed drd mutant background, enhanced expression reporters      observed. addition, manipulation drd expression tracheae did affect expression hypoxia-induced
     genes LDH, tango, similar. Overall, results indicate causes adult lethality drd
     mutants, gut dysfunction neurodegeneration independent phenotypes, neurodegeneration      associated tracheal expression drd hypoxia.
