INTRODUCTION
     Saccharomyces cerevisiae coordinately regulates expression different amino
acid biosynthetic genes response starvation various amino acids (reviewed 1,2). cross-pathway regulation, termed general control, affects isoleucine tRNA synthetase

DISCUSSION
     GCDJ originally defined single allele prevented growth high temperature caused constitutive induction amino acid biosynthetic genes lower temperatures
(13). paper, obtained overlapping genomic segments complemented temperature-sensitive phenotype caused gcdl-1 allele mapped genetically GCDI
locus. 2.4 kb GCDJ DNA fragment encoding single open reading frame 511 amino acids
restored normal regulation HIS3 presumably amino acid biosynthetic genes. addition, fragment fully complemented phenotypes exhibited new gcdl
mutant alleles (17).  likely single protein product carries known GCDI
functions.
      temperature-sensitive phenotype gcdl-l suggested GCDI encoded essential
function. confirmed showing disruption GCDI locus lethal event. lethal phenotype probably analogous cell-cycle phenotype observed gcdl-1 cells shifted restrictive temperature. GCDI clearly involved general control amino acid biosynthesis translational control GCN4 activator

       alternative view, favor, GCDI involved translational

      Yeast cells initiate new cell cycles sufficient amino acids complete cycle. Auxotrophs particular amino acid arrest start cell cycle switched medium lacking amino acid. Interestingly, gcdl mutants viable days shift 370C, situation similar auxotrophic cells starving required amino acid. gcdl strains retain normal levels charged tRNAs restrictive temperature actually starving amino acids (18), GCDI sensing
