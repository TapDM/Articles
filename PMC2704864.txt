     Abstract
     Background: RNA interference (RNAi) induced double stranded RNA (dsRNA) used widely study gene
     function insects. Recently, reported gene knockdown insects induced successfully
     feeding dsRNA.  unknown phenotypic silencing genes expressed      midgut occurs ingestion insect dsRNA.

     Principal Findings: Using chitin synthase gene (SeCHSA) target gene, expressed cuticle tracheae
     lepidopteran pest Spodoptera exigua, showed growth development S. exigua larvae fed Escherichia
     coli expressing dsRNA SeCHSA disturbed, resulting lethality. 4th 5th larval instars, prepupae, pupae,

     Conclusions: results suggest SeCHSA dsRNA useful means insect pest control.
