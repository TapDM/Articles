 Drosophila melanogaster Myb-MuvB/dREAM complex (MMB/dREAM) participates activation repres-
sion developmentally regulated genes origins DNA replication. Mutants MMB subunits exhibit diverse pheno-
types, including lethality, eye defects, reduced fecundity, sterility.  used P-element excision generate muta-

Interestingly, maternal-effect embryonic lethality, larval lethality, adult eye defects suppressed mutations subunits MMB/dREAM complex. results suggest partial MMB/dREAM complex responsible lethality eye defects lin-52 mutants. Furthermore, findings support model Lin-52 Myb proteins counteract repressive activities members MMB/dREAM complex specific genomic loci developmentally controlled manner.
