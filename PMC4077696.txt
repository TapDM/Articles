PMV gene refractory deletion, suggesting      essential, definitive proof lacking.  generated PEXEL-mimetic inhibitor potently blocks activity      PMV isolated P. falciparum Plasmodium vivax. Assessment PMV activity P. falciparum revealed PEXEL cleavage
     occurs cotranslationaly, similar signal peptidase. Treatment P. falciparum–infected erythrocytes inhibitor
