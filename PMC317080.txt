Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis controls abundance cell cycle regulatory proteins. Recent work Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggests complex consisting Cdc53, Skp1, component known F-box protein (termed SCF) combination Cdc34 specifically targets regulatory proteins degradation, substrate specificity likely mediated F-box subunit. screen genetic

components. Furthermore, physical interactions Met30, Cdc53, Cdc34, Skp1 vivo provide
evidence SCFMet30 complex. demonstrate involvement Met30 degradation Cdk-inhibitory kinase Swe1. Swe1 stabilized met30 mutants GST-Met30 pull experiments

published results, provide evidence distinct SCF complexes vivo support idea F-box subunits mediate SCF substrate specificity.
