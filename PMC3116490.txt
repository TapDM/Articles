  Abstract
  Background: Constraint-based approaches facilitate prediction cellular metabolic capabilities, based, turn
  predictions repertoire enzymes encoded genome. Recently, genome annotations   used reconstruct genome scale metabolic reaction networks numerous species, including Homo sapiens,
  allow simulations provide valuable insights topics, including predictions gene essentiality   pathogens, interpretation genetic polymorphism metabolic disease syndromes suggestions novel
  approaches microbial metabolic engineering. constraint-based simulations integrated   functional genomics portals, activity requires efficient implementation constraint-based simulations
  web-based environment.
  Results:  present Acorn, open source (GNU GPL) grid computing constraint-based
  simulations genome scale metabolic reaction networks interactive web environment. grid-
  based architecture allows efficient execution computationally intensive, iterative protocols Flux
