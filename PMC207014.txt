Gp210 evolutionarily conserved membrane protein nuclear pore complex (NPC). studied phenotypes
produced RNAi-induced downregulation gp210 human (HeLa) cells Caenorhabditis elegans embryos.
HeLa cell viability requires Gp210 activity. dying cells accumulated clustered NPCs aberrant membrane
structures nuclear envelope, suggesting gp210 required directly indirectly nuclear pore formation dilation anchoring structural integrity mature NPCs. Essential roles gp210 confirmed C.
elegans, RNAi-induced reduction gp210 caused embryonic lethality. nuclear envelopes embryos reduced gp210 aberrant nuclear membrane structures clustered NPCs, confirming gp210 plays critical
roles nuclear membrane mechanisms conserved nematodes humans.
