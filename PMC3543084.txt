ABSTRACT  dBCAS2 (CG4980, human Breast Carcinoma Amplified Sequence 2 ortholog) essential viability Drosophila melanogaster. ubiquitous tissue-specific depletion dBCAS2 leads larval lethality, wing
deformities, impaired splicing, apoptosis. importantly, overexpression hBCAS2 rescues defects.
Furthermore, C-terminal coiled-coil domain hBCAS2 binds directly CDC5L recruits hPrp19/PLRG1 form core complex splicing mammalian cells partially restore wing damage induced knocking dBCAS2 flies. summary, Drosophila human BCAS2 share similar function RNA splicing, affects cell viability.
Keywords: BCAS2; Drosophila; viability; splicing; Prp19 complex
