A Missense Mutation PRPF6 Causes

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) inherited form retinal degeneration leads progressive visual-field constriction blindness. disease manifests retina, mutations ubiquitously expressed genes associated tri-snRNP complex spliceosome identified patients dominantly inherited RP. screened mutations PRPF6 (NM_012469.3), gene chromosome 20q13.33 encoding essential protein tri-snRNP assembly stability, 188 unrelated patients auto-
somal-dominant RP identified missense mutation, c.2185C>T (p.Arg729Trp). change affected residue conserved humans yeast cosegregated disease family identified. Lymphoblasts derived patients mutation showed abnormal localization endogenous PRPF6 nucleus. Specifically, protein accumulated Cajal

Furthermore, analysis endogenous transcripts cells patients revealed intron retention pre-mRNA bearing specific splicing signals, according pattern displayed lymphoblasts mutations PRPF genes. results identify PRPF6 sixth gene involved pre-mRNA splicing dominant RP, corroborating hypothesis deficiencies spliceosome play important role molecular pathology disease.
