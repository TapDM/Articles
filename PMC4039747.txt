  Abstract
  Background: Essential genes critical development organisms associated   human diseases. genes difficult category study prior availability balanced lethal
  strains. Despite power targeted mutagenesis, limitations identifying mutations essential genes.
  paper, identification coding regions essential genes mutated using forward genetic
  screens Caenorhabditis elegans. lethal mutations described isolated maintained wild-type
  allele rescuing duplication.
  Results: applied genome sequencing identify causative molecular lesion resulting lethality   existing C. elegans mutant strains. strains balanced easily maintained subsequent
  characterization. method effectively used analyze mutations large number essential genes.
  identification 64 essential genes region chromosome covered duplication
  sDp2.  42 nonsense mutations, splice signal mutations, deletion, 15 non-synonymous
  mutations. essential genes region function cell cycle, transcriptional regulation, RNA processing.
  Conclusions: essential genes identified represented mutant strains,   mutant allele. genetic resource utilized understanding essential gene function   applicable study C. elegans development, conserved cellular function, ultimately lead improved
  human health.
