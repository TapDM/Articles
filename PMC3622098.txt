Discussion
  believe Tet systems greatly facilitate analysis gene function, particularly cell systems difficult manipulate   manipulated gene essential cell survival. Furthermore, ability control gene expression highly specific Tet systems
  offers opportunity study gene functions different stages  example cell cycle progression defined differentiation
  processes). method presented enable researchers generate desired stable Tet cell lines reasonable time frame
  (normally 3-6 months, largely depending extent molecular cell biological profiling necessary characterization TetR-
  positive cell lines). successful generation application Tet cell lines,  critically dependent factors.

   selection cells sufficiently high expression TetR required ensure stringent repression transcription absence   tetracycline. Equally important, initial characterization target cells expressing TetR cover possible molecular cell
  biological parameters studied long term. experience, characterized TetR-positive cell line good starting
  point numerous research projects.

  Second, necessary tetracycline concentration low possible prevent possible pleiotropic effects testing   analyzing Tet clones shRNA/cDNA expression.
