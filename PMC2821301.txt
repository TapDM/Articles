  Abstract
  Background: J-domain-containing protein auxilin, critical regulator clathrin-mediated transport,   implicated Drosophila Notch signaling. ask role auxilin conserved auxilin   additional roles development, investigated functions auxilin orthologs zebrafish.
  Results: Like mammals, zebrafish distinct auxilin-like molecules, auxilin cyclin G-associated kinase
  (GAK), differing domain structures expression patterns. zebrafish auxilin GAK functionally
  substitute Drosophila auxilin, suggesting overlapping molecular functions.    completely redundant, morpholino-mediated knockdown ubiquitously expressed GAK increase
  specification neuronal cells, known Notch-dependent process, decrease expression Her4,   Notch target gene. Furthermore, inhibition GAK function caused elevated level apoptosis neural tissues,
  resulting severe degeneration neural structures.
  Conclusion: support notion endocytosis plays important roles Notch signaling, inhibition   zebrafish GAK function affects embryonic neuronal cell specification Her4 expression. addition, analysis
  suggests zebrafish GAK functions development neural tissues: early Notch-
