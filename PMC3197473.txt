 Abstract
 Background: Despite detailed vivo knowledge glycolytic enolases bacterial non-enolase members
 superfamily, little known vivo function vertebrate non-enolase enolase superfamily
 members (ENOSF1s). Results previous studies suggest involvement b splice form ENOSF1 breast  colon cancers. study used zebrafish (Danio rerio) vertebrate model ENOSF1b function.
 Results: mount situ hybridization (WISH) showed zebrafish ENOSF1b (enosf1b) zygotic  expressed ubiquitously 24 hours post fertilization (hpf). 24 hpf, enosf1b expression  restricted notochord. Embryos injected enosf1b-EGFP mRNA grew slower EGFP mRNA-injected
 embryos caught EGFP-injected embryos 48 hpf. Embryos injected ATG exon 10 enosf1b
 mRNA-targeting morpholinos kinked notochords, shortened anterior-posterior axes, circulatory edema.
 WISH ntl pax2a expression showed embryos injected morpholino deformed notochord
 pronephros. TUNEL staining revealed increased apoptosis peri-notochord region.
 Conclusions: study report ENOSF1 function vertebrate shows ENOSF1 required
 embryonic development. Increased apoptosis following enosf1b knockdown suggests potential survival
 advantage increased ENOSF1b expression human cancers.
