     Abstract
     Reverse genetics mosquito Anopheles gambiae RNAi mediated gene silencing led recent years      advanced understanding mosquito immune response infections bacteria malaria parasites.      developed RNAi screens  gambiae hemocyte-like cells using library double-stranded RNAs targeting 109 genes
     expressed highly specifically mosquito hemocytes identify novel regulators hemocyte immune response.
     Assays included phagocytosis bacterial bioparticles, expression antimicrobial peptide CEC1, basal induced
     expression mosquito complement factor LRIM1. cell viability screen carried assess dsRNA
     cytotoxicity identify genes involved cell growth survival. results identify 22 novel immune regulators,
     including proteins putatively involved phagosome assembly maturation (Ca2+ channel, v-ATPase cyclin-
     dependent protein kinase), pattern recognition (fibrinogen-domain lectins Nimrod), immune modulation (peptidase
     serine protease homolog), immune signaling (Eiger LPS-induced factor), cell adhesion communication (Laminin
     B1 Ninjurin) immune homeostasis (Lipophorin receptor). development robust functional cell-based assays
     paves way genome-wide functional screens study mosquito immune response infections human
     pathogens.
