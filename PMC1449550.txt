                Mus101 family chromosomal proteins, identified initially Drosophila, widely conserved              shown function variety DNA metabolic processes. functions include DNA replication, DNA
             damage repair, postreplication repair, damage checkpoint activation, chromosome stability, chromosome

Despite conservation widespread involvement chromosome biogenesis, little              known Mus101 regulated proteins required Mus101 exert              functions. learn Mus101, initiated analysis protein C. elegans.               C. elegans mus-101 essential gene, required DNA replication,              plays important role DNA damage response. Furthermore, use RNA interference (RNAi)-
             mediated reverse genetics screen genes modify mus-101 partial loss function RNAi phenotype.
             Using systematic approach modifier gene discovery, chromosome genes
