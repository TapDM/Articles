LinkHub: Semantic Web facilitates cross-database
queries information retrieval proteomics


                 Abstract
                 Background: key abstraction representing proteomics knowledge notion unique
                 identifiers individual entities (e.g. proteins) massive graph relationships 
                 relationships simple (e.g. synonyms) complex (e.g. 
                 relationships protein family membership).
                 Results: built software called LinkHub using Semantic Web RDF manages
                 graph identifier relationships allows exploration variety interfaces.                  efficiency, provide relational-database access translation relational                  RDF versions. LinkHub practically useful creating small, local hubs common topics                  connecting major portals federated architecture; used LinkHub establish
                 relationship UniProt North East Structural Genomics Consortium.
                 LinkHub facilitates queries access information documents related identifiers
                 spread multiple databases, acting "connecting glue" different identifier spaces.
                 demonstrate example queries discovering "interologs" yeast protein interactions
                 worm exploring relationship gene essentiality pseudogene content.                  "protein family based" retrieval documents achieved. LinkHub available
                 hub.gersteinlab.org hub.nesg.org supplement, database models source code.
                 Conclusion: LinkHub leverages Semantic Web standards-based integrated data provide novel
                 information retrieval identifier-related documents relational graph queries, simplifies
                 manages connections major hubs UniProt, provides useful interactive query
                 interfaces exploring integrated data.
