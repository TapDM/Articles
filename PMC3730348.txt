Interestingly, investigation revealed attachment proteins present higher number macromolecular complexes core proteins. observed protein complex number (defined number protein complexes protein subunit belongs) stronger influence gene/protein essentiality multifunctionality. Finally, results suggest observed differences rates protein evolution core attachment proteins differences protein complex number expression level.  conclude proteins present higher numbers macromolecular complexes enhance overall expression level increasing transcription rate translation rate, protein complex number
