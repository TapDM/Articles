     Abstract
     cytochrome b5 domain containing 2 (CYB5D2; Neuferricin) protein reported bind heme,       critical residues responsible heme-binding undefined. Furthermore, relationship heme-binding      CYB5D2-mediated intracellular functions remains unknown. Previous studies examining heme-binding cytochrome
     b5 heme-binding domain-containing proteins, damage-associated protein 1 (Dap1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae) human
     progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), revealed conserved tyrosine (Y) 73, Y79, aspartic acid
     (D) 86, Y127 residues present human CYB5D2 involved heme-binding. CYB5D2 binds type b heme,
      substitution glycine (G) D86 (D86G) cytochrome b5 heme-binding (cyt-b5) domain
     abolished heme-binding ability. CYB5D2 CYB5D2(D86G) localize endoplasmic reticulum. Ectopic CYB5D2
     expression inhibited cell proliferation anchorage-independent colony growth HeLa cells. Conversely, CYB5D2
     knockdown ectopic CYB5D2(D86G) expression increased cell proliferation colony growth. PGRMC1      reported regulate expression activities cytochrome P450 proteins (CYPs), examined role CYB5D2      regulating activities CYPs involved sterol synthesis (CYP51A1) drug metabolism (CYP3A4). CYB5D2 localizes
     cytochrome P450 reductase (CYPOR), CYB5D2 knockdown reduced lanosterol demethylase (CYP51A1) levels      rendered HeLa cells sensitive mevalonate. Additionally, knockdown CYB5D2 reduced CYP3A4 activity. Lastly, CYB5D2
     expression conferred HeLa cell survival chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel, cisplatin doxorubicin), ability
     promote survival dependent heme-binding ability. Taken  study provides evidence heme-
     binding critical CYB5D2 regulating HeLa cell growth survival, endogenous CYB5D2 required      modulate CYP activities.
