     Abstract
     Damage initiates pleiotropic cellular response aimed cellular survival appropriate. identify genes required      damage survival, used cell-based RNAi screen Drosophila genome alkylating agent methyl
     methanesulphonate (MMS). Similar studies performed model organisms report damage response involve
     pleiotropic cellular processes central DNA repair components, intuitive systems level view      cellular components required damage survival, interrelationship, contextual importance lacking.
      comparing data different model organisms, identification conserved presumably core survival
     components forthcoming. identified 307 genes, representing 13 signaling, metabolic, enzymatic pathways,
     affecting cellular survival MMS–induced damage. expected, majority pathways involved DNA repair;
      pathways diverse biological functions identified, including TOR pathway,
     transcription, translation, proteasome, glutathione synthesis, ATP synthesis, Notch signaling, equally
     important damage survival. Comparison genomic screen data Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed overlap

     conservation pathways, tested Drosophila mouse cells, pathway responding alkylation

     components 13 identified pathways network. Grouping proteins ‘‘pathway nodes’’ qualitatively
