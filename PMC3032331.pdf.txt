Vital function PRELI essential requirement LEA motif

Proteins containing late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) motif comprise conserved family, postulated act cell
protectors.  function mechanisms action remain unclear. PRELI, mammalian LEA-
containing homolog yeast Ups1p, associate dynamin-like GTPase Optic Atrophy-1 (OPA1) contribute maintenance mitochondrial morphology. Accordingly, PRELI uphold mitochondrial membrane potential (DWm) enhance respiratory chain (RC) function, shown capacity induce complex NADH dehydrogenase ATP synthase
expression, increase oxygen consumption reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. PRELI inhibit cell
death induced STS, TNF UV irradiation.  vitro vivo dominant-negative overexpression mutant
PRELI/LEA (lacking LEA motif) transient vitro PRELI-specific knockdown render lymphocytes vulnerable apoptosis, cause mouse embryo lethality revert resistance lymphoma cells induced death. Collectively, data
support long-presumed notion LEA protein-dependent mechanisms cytoprotection suggest PRELI interacts OPA1 maintain mitochondria structures intact, sustain balanced ion/proton þ gradients, promote oxidative
phosphorylation reactions, regulate pro- antiapoptotic protein traffic enable cell responses induced death. findings help understand bioenergetics mechanistically connected cell survival cues.
