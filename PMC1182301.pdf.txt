Centrins, small calcium binding EF-hand proteins, function duplication variety microtubule organizing
centers. include centrioles humans, basal bodies green algae, spindle pole bodies yeast. ciliate
Tetrahymena thermophila contains centrin genes determined sequence homology, distinct localization expression patterns. CEN1’s role basal body examined closely. Cen1 protein
localizes primarily locations: site base basal body duplication initiated. transition zone basal body axoneme. CEN1 essential gene, deletion results loss basal bodies, likely defects basal body duplication basal body maintenance.
Analysis centrins indicates function microtubule-rich structures unique ciliates, fourth expressed conditions examined study, artificially expressed localizes basal bodies. study provides evidence addition previously known function duplication basal bodies, centrin important integrity organelles.
