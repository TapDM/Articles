     Abstract
     identified LmaPA2G4, homolog human proliferation-associated 2G4 protein  termed Ebp1),      phosphoproteomic screening. Multiple sequence alignment cluster analysis revealed LmaPA2G4 non-peptidase
     member M24 family metallopeptidases. pseudoenzyme structurally related methionine aminopeptidases.      null mutant based negative selection allowed demonstrate LmaPA2G4 essential gene Leishmania
     major. expression LmaPA2G4 did alter cell morphology ability differentiate metacyclic amastigote
     stages. Interestingly, expression affected cell proliferation virulence mouse footpad analysis. LmaPA2G4 binds      synthetic double-stranded RNA polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid [poly C)] shown electrophoretic mobility shift
     assay (EMSA). Quantitative proteomics revealed expression LmaPA2G4 led accumulation factors involved      translation initiation elongation. Significantly, strong reduction novo protein biosynthesis transgenic
     parasites using non-radioactive metabolic labeling assay. conclusion, LmaPA2G4 essential gene potentially
     implicated fundamental biological mechanisms, translation, making attractive target therapeutic intervention.
