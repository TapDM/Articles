Mitochondria play central role regulation programmed cell death signaling.  report finding mitochondrial matrix-targeted protein phosphatase 2C family member (PP2Cm) regulates
mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening essential cell survival,
embryonic development, cardiac function. PP2Cm highly conserved vertebrates, highest expression levels detected heart brain. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown PP2Cm resulted cell death associated loss mitochondrial membrane potential cultured cardiac
mycoytes induction hepatocyte apoptosis vivo. PP2Cm-deficient mitochondria showed elevated
susceptibility calcium-induced MPTP opening, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activities affected. Finally, inactivation PP2Cm developing zebrafish embryos caused abnormal cardiac neural development heart failure associated induced apoptosis. data suggest PP2Cm novel mitochondrial protein phosphatase critical function cell death survival, play role regulating MPTP opening.
