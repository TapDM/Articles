     Abstract
     Long-chain flavodoxins, ubiquitous electron shuttles containing flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic group, play      important protective role reactive oxygen species (ROS) various microorganisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa      opportunistic pathogen frequently face ROS toxicity environment host.      identified single ORF, referred fldP  flavodoxin P. aeruginosa), displaying highest similarity      length, sequence identity predicted secondary structure typical long-chain flavodoxins. gene cloned      expressed Escherichia coli. recombinant product (FldP) bind FMN exhibited flavodoxin activity vitro.
     Expression fldP P. aeruginosa induced oxidative stress conditions OxyR-independent mechanism,
     fldP-null mutant accumulated higher intracellular ROS levels exhibited decreased tolerance H2O2 toxicity
