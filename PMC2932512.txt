ABSTRACT Amadori-modified proteins (AMPs) products nonenzymatic glycation formed reaction reducing sug-
ars primary amine-containing amino acids develop advanced glycated end products (AGEs), highly stable toxic
compounds. AGEs known participate age-related human diseases, including cardiovascular, neurological, liver diseases. metabolism glycated proteins understood, mechanisms reduce accumula-

Using mutants, Gcp depletion results accumulation AMPs eventually leads accumulation AGEs. demonstrate Gcp binds glycated proteins, including pyruvate dehydrogenase, previously shown glycation-prone enzyme. experiments severe phenotype Gcp depletion relieved condi-
