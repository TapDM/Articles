                 Abstract
                 Background: Global analyses human disease genes computational methods yielded
                 important advances understanding human diseases. Generally studies treated
                 group disease genes uniformly, ignoring type disease-causing mutations (dominant
                 recessive). report present comprehensive study evolutionary history                  autosomal disease genes separated mode inheritance.
                 Results: examine differences protein coding sequence conservation dominant
                 recessive human disease genes. analysis shows disease genes affected dominant
                 mutations conserved affected recessive mutations.                  consequence fact recessive mutations remain hidden selection heterozygous.
                 Furthermore, employ functional annotation analysis investigations disease severity                  support hypothesis.
                 Conclusion: study elucidates important differences dominantly- recessively-
                 acting disease genes terms protein DNA sequence conservation, paralogy essentiality.
                 propose division disease genes mode inheritance enhance                  understanding disease process prediction candidate disease genes future.
