ABSTRACT mitochondrial RNA binding complex 1 (MRB1) recently discovered complex proteins associated TbRGG1 TbRGG2 proteins Trypanosoma brucei. Based phenotype caused regulation proteins, proposed play unspecified role RNA editing. RNAi silencing newly characterized protein subunits, guide RNA

encoded guide (g) RNAs required.  editing remains unaffected maxicircle-encoded cis-acting gRNA employed. Interestingly, proteins necessary expression minicircle-encoded gRNAs.  
regulation fourth assayed putative MRB1 subunit, Nudix hydrolase, does appear destabilize gRNAs, 
regulation protein general impact stability maxicircle-encoded RNAs. GAP1 2 essential survival bloodstream stage, gRNAs eliminated depletion protein.
Immunolocalization revealed GAP1 2 concentrated discrete spots mitochondrion, usually localized proximity kinetoplast. Finally, demonstrate mtRNA polymerase known transcribe maxicircle mRNAs role expression minicircle-encoded gRNAs.
