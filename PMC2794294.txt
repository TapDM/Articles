    Abstract
Aging degenerative process characterized progressive deterioration cellular components organelles resulting mortality. nematode Caenorhabditis elegans emerged principal model used study biology aging. virtually biological
subsystem undergoes functional decline increasing age, life span primary endpoint considering total rate aging. nematodes, life span typically defined number days animal remains responsive external stimuli. Nematodes propagated liquid media solid media plates, techniques developed measuring life span conditions. present generalized protocol measuring life span nematodes maintained solid nematode growth media fed diet UV-killed
bacteria. procedures easily adapted assay life span various common conditions, including diet consisting live bacteria,
dietary restriction, RNA interference.


    Protocol 1: Prepare nematode growth media (NGM) plates
  section describes preparation solid NGM plates use life span experiment. basic life span experiment requires types
  plates: standard NGM plates, contain additives, Amp/FUDR plates, ampicillin (Amp) fluorodeoxyuridine
  (FUDR) added NGM. Ampicillin used prevent foreign bacterial contamination. FUDR inhibits cell division, reduces egg production,   prevents eggs hatching. use FUDR longevity analysis does affect adult life span removes need transfer worms
  days order separate growing larva. types plates seeded E. coli OP50 bacteria, subsequently
  killed exposure UV.

  1. Prepare NGM  Section 5 recipe storage notes) label petri plates. need 1 60 mm petri plate 10 mL NGM.       starting previously prepared solid NGM, continue step 1.2. starting freshly autoclaved NGM, skip step 1.4.
  2. Completely melt solid NGM microwaving high 30 second pulses. Swirl media pulses prevent pressurized gas bubbles
      building 
  3. Place liquid NGM 55 °C water bath bench cool.
  4. NGM reaches 55 °C add 33 µL 150 mM FUDR 100 µL 100 mg/mL Ampicillin 100 mL NGM  Amp/FUDR plates)       swirl mix. NGM plates additional drugs proceed directly step 1.5.
  5. Using sterile technique, pipette 10 mL NGM 60 mm petri plate. Avoid forming bubbles possible. bubbles form,       popped using pipette tip.
  6. Leave plates bench lids allow NGM solidify dry. possible, leave plates bench 2 days adding bacteria,
      1 day work plates needed sooner.
  7. day plates finish drying, seed liquid LB culture single colony fresh streak E. coli OP50 bacteria LB agar.
      prepare 1 mL overnight OP50 culture 60 mm plate.
  8. Place OP50 culture 37 °C shaker allow bacteria grow overnight (culture reach saturation).
  9. Pellet OP50 bacteria spinning 3,500 g 10 minutes.
  10. Remove 90  supernatant resuspend bacteria concentrate culture 10x.
  11. Pipette 100 µL 10x concentrated OP50 culture center solidified NGM plates. Swirl plates gently spread bacteria culture       needed (ideally bacteria cover central area NGM coming near plate walls). Try avoid touching pipette tip       surface NGM, flaws surface media allow worms burrow NGM.
  12. Leave plates bench overnight allow bacteria culture dry solid NGM (typically takes 24 hours).
  13. dry, expose surface plates UV dose sufficient arrest growth bacteria. using Stratagene UV
      Stratalinker 2400:
         • Place plates Stratalinker remove lids
         • Close door turn Stratalinker
         • Press ‘Energy’
         • Enter ‘9999’ using keypad
         • Press ‘Start’
         • plates exposed UV approximately 5 minutes

  14. Plates UV-killed bacteria stored upside 4 °C 1 month.
 2: Perform timed egg laying acquire age-synchronized population animals
  section generate population worms common hatch-date. accomplished allowing reproductively active adults lay
  eggs plate defined period time allowing eggs develop.

  1. (Optional) Transfer approximately 20 young adult worms fresh NGM plate FUDR. Leave plates 25 °C order allow worms
     propagate eat bacterial food. bacterial food consumed newly hatched worms enter growth
     arrested dauer stage. start dauer larva week, depending worms transfer plate initially.
     Dauer larva used steps 1 month.
  2. (Optional) Transfer 20 30 dauer larva fresh NGM plate FUDR. presence food dauer larva reproductively
     active adults 2 days remain reproductively active days 25 °C.
  3. Transfer 10 15 reproductively active adults fresh NGM plate FUDR. plate referred timed egg laying (TEL)
     plate.
  4. Leave TEL plate 25 °C 6 hours order allow worms time lay eggs.
  5. Remove adult worms TEL plate. Plate visually inspected eggs removing adults. worms laid sufficient
     number eggs TEL plate left 25 °C total 24 hours removing adult worms.
  6. Place TEL plate 20 °C eggs hatched worms developed L4 larval stage  usually takes 2 days wild
     type C. elegans, longer strains slow development phenotypes).
 3: Score animals life span
  section follow age-synchronized population worms 2 die. Worms maintained Amp/FUDR plates   prevent egg production bacterial contamination considered dead fail respond external stimuli.

  1. Transfer L4 larva seeded Amp/FUDR plates. strain condition tested, typical set 2-3 plates 25-30 worms
     plate. Images C. elegans life stages provided reference (Figure 1).1
  2. Place Amp/FUDR plates 20 °C 24 hours.
  3. 24 hours, visually assess worms, media, bacteria. Transfer worms fresh Amp/FUDR plates following observed:
       • Worms eaten bacterial food. Early life span experiment worms transferred 1 2 times week             prevent bacteria depleted.
       • significant number larvae present. usually indication worms transferred Amp/FUDR plates             young adults instead L4s able lay eggs FUDR took effect. FUDR generally prevent larvae
            growing adults, occasionally grow adults confused experimental animals.
       • Live /growing bacteria observed. Generally, combination Amp UV-killing ensure live bacteria contaminate             experiment, occasionally occurs.
       • Fungal growth observed media. caught early  fungal growth usually cut using pipette tip spatula.
            grows larger millimeters diameter usually easier transfer worms new plate.
       • Using dissection scope, determine worm alive dead.
       • Gently tap plate. worm alive moves response tapping.
       • worm does respond tapping plate, zoom head region.
       • Gently tap worm’s head platinum transfer pick. Score worm dead does respond moving head.
       • Dead worms removed plate.

  4. Record date number worms alive dead.
  5. Return plates 20 °C.
  6. Repeat steps 3.3 3.6 2 3 days worms died.
 4: Representative Results.
  raw data produced nematode life span experiment list dates corresponding numbers worms alive dead   strain tested. number worms die day typically inverted calculate proportion worms alive day (Figure
  2A), plotted graphically survival curve (Figure 2B; day timed egg laying considered day 0). life span   individual worm study calculated count worms die day used calculate mean median life span   comparison strains. count number worms alive day used directly life span analysis. Worms maintained   solid media occasionally ‘flee’, crawl wall plate beneath media. number worms alive day
  used determine worms fled course experiment. Worms flee typically removed analysis.   benchmark, typical median life span N2, C. elegans wild-type strain, maintained UV-killed bacteria 20 °C approximately 25
  days measured egg.
