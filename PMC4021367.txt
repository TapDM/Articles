  Abstract
  Background: Thermus thermophilus, extremely thermophilic bacterium, widely recognized model
  organism studying microbes survive adapt high temperature environment.    thermotolerant mechanisms cellular metabolism remains unravelled.  highly required   consider systems biological approaches T. thermophilus metabolic network model employed   high throughput experimental data elucidating physiological characteristics harsh
  conditions.
  Results: reconstructed genome-scale metabolic model T. thermophilus, iTT548, large-scale
  network thermophilic bacterium, accounting 548 unique genes, 796 reactions 635 unique metabolites.
  initial comparative analysis model Escherichia coli revealed distinctive metabolic reactions,
  mainly amino acid metabolism carotenoid biosynthesis, producing relevant compounds retain cellular
  membrane withstanding high temperature. Constraints-based flux analysis   applied simulate   metabolic state glucose minimal amino acid rich media. Remarkably, resulting growth predictions   highly consistent experimental observations. subsequent comparative flux analysis different
  environmental conditions highlighted cells consumed branched chain amino acids preferably utilized
  directly relevant anabolic pathways fatty acid synthesis. Finally, gene essentiality study   conducted single gene deletion analysis, identify conditional essential genes glucose minimal   complex media.
  Conclusions: reconstructed genome-scale metabolic model elucidates phenotypes T. thermophilus,   allowing gain valuable insights cellular metabolism silico simulations. information obtained
  analysis shed light understanding physiology thermophiles helps   devise metabolic engineering strategies develop T. thermophilus thermostable microbial cell factory.
