     Abstract
     Background: Protein-O-mannosyltransferases (Pmt’s) catalyze initial step protein-O-glycosylation, addition      mannose residues serine threonine residues target proteins.

     Methodology/Principal Findings: Based protein similarities, highly conserved protein family divided      subfamilies: Pmt1 sub-family, Pmt2 sub-family Pmt4 sub-family. contrast Saccharomyces
