     Abstract
     Ctf18-replication factor C complex including Dscc1 (DNA replication sister chromatid cohesion 1) implicated sister
     chromatid cohesion, DNA replication, genome stability S. cerevisiae C. elegans. previously performed gene
     expression profiling primary colorectal cancer cells order identify novel molecular targets treatment      colorectal cancer. feature cancer-associated transcriptional signature revealed effort elevated
     expression proto-oncogene DSCC1.  interrogated molecular basis deviant expression human
     DSCC1 colorectal cancer ability promote survival cancer cells. Quantitative PCR immunohistochemical
     analyses corroborated expression level DSCC1 elevated 60–70  colorectal tumors compared      matched noncancerous colonic mucosa. silico evaluation presumptive DSCC1 promoter region consensus
     DNA transcriptional regulatory elements revealed potential role E2F family DNA-binding proteins controlling
     DSCC1 expression. RNAi-mediated reduction E2F1 reduced expression DSCC1 colorectal cancer cells. Gain- loss-
     function experiments demonstrated DSCC1 involved viability cancer cells response genotoxic
     stimuli. reveal E2F-dependent expression DSCC1 confers anti-apoptotic properties colorectal cancer cells,      suppression useful option treatment colorectal cancer.
