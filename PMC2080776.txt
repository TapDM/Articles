Background. Dietary restriction (DR) reduced insulin/IGF like signaling (IIS) regimens promote longevity variety organisms. Genetic analysis C. elegans nematodes shown DR IIS couple distinct cellular signaling
pathways.  known pathways ultimately converge overlapping distinct targets extend
lifespan. Principal Findings. investigated question examining additional effects DR wildtype animals daf-2 mutants moderate severe IIS deficits. Surprisingly, DR IIS opposing effects physiological
processes.  DR induced stress-related change intestinal vesicle trafficking, termed response, suppressed daf-2 mutants. Second, DR did strongly affect expression daf-2- stress-responsive transcriptional
reporter. Finally, DR-related growth impairment suppressed daf-2 mutants. Conclusions. findings reveal important biological function DAF-2/IIS enhance growth survival nutrient-limited conditions.  discovered levels DAF-2 pathway activity modified effects DR longevity.  DR IIS clearly
affect lifespan independent targets, prolongevity targets convergently regulated pathways.
